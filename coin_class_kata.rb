# Coin changer kata

# Write a function that takes a number of cents, and that returns a hash containing the least number of coins needed to generate the value of cents.

# eg. If you have 11 cents you should return {:dime => 1, :penny => 1};
# eg. If you have 31 cents you should return {:quarter => 1, :nickel => 1, :penny => 1};
# eg. If you have 93 cents {:quarter => 3, :dime => 1, nickel => 1, :penny => 3}

def generate_change(cents)
	if cents == 0
		{}
	elsif cents == 5
		{:nickel => 1}
	else
		{:penny => cents}
	end
